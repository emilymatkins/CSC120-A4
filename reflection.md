- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

When I first started this assignment building the different classes I did not understand encapsulation. After working with the Train class I was starting to understand the concept. The main adivce if would give somone taking this course in the future is to start the projects early and get support when you need it. My friends who have taken this course in the past have been helpful to fully understandinf how and why things work in my code. I have also found the TA tutors especially useful.
